## 1. EPILEPSY

### Mechanisms of Action
- **Energy Regulation**: Slows energy availability, stabilizes and reduces neuronal excitability
- **Neurotransmitter Modulation**:
  - Excitatory: Inhibits VGLUT1 (vesicular glutamate transporter), reduces glutamate release
  - Beta-hydroxybutyrate directly inhibits AMPA receptors
  - Inhibitory: Increases GABA synthesis via glutamate decarboxylase, elevates GABA in CSF
- **Ion Channel Effects**: 
  - Increases ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP) leading to hyperpolarization
  - Activates K2P channels for continuous K+ flow
- **Pathway Modulation**:
  - Bad protein modifications
  - Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  - mTOR pathway inhibition
  - Nrf2 upregulation (antioxidant response)
- **Inflammatory Control**: Inhibits caspase-3, regulates NLRP3 inflammasome
- **Microbiome**: Changes gut microbiota composition

### Clinical Evidence
- **Controlled Trials**: Multiple RCTs in pediatric drug-resistant epilepsy
- **Efficacy**: >50% seizure reduction in completers
- **Challenges**: High dropout rates due to:
  - Dietary strictness and monotony
  - Side effects: constipation, GERD, hypercholesterolemia, lack of energy, vomiting
- **Benefits Beyond Seizures**: Improvements in cognition and behavior
- **Meta-Analyses**: Positive efficacy and safety demonstrated, though some results inconclusive
