**Citation**: Zhang M, Zhang Q, Huang S, Lu Y, Peng M. Impact of ketogenic diets on cancer patient outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Front Nutr. 2025;12:1535921.

**Study Type**: Systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO CRD42024553878)

**Key Findings**:

### Outcomes - Significant Improvements with KD vs. Non-KD:
- **Reduced**: Fat mass, visceral fat, insulin levels, blood glucose, fatigue, insomnia
- **Improved**: LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, TSH levels, protein uptake, emotional function, social function
- **Induced ketosis**: Increased β-hydroxybutyrate levels

### Optimal Diet Composition (for C-reactive protein reduction):
- **Carbohydrates**: 2-4%
- **Protein**: 16-18%
- **Fat**: 80-85%
- **Duration**: >12 weeks for greatest benefit

### Cancer Types Studied:
- Primary focus: Glioma and breast cancer
- Also studied: Various cancer types (lung, colorectal mentioned in introduction)

### Mechanisms Proposed:
1. Alters cellular metabolism to inhibit tumor growth
2. Improves tolerance of normal cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy
3. May enhance PD-1 blockade immunotherapy effectiveness
4. Modulates metabolic pathways

### Safety & Tolerability:
- KD described as "safe and effective complementary therapy"
- Improved patient tolerance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy
- Reduced side effects from conventional treatments

### Evidence Level:
- **Moderate to Strong** for adjunctive cancer therapy
- Multiple controlled clinical trials (CCTs) support findings
- Published July 2025 [RECENT]

### Clinical Context:
- Traditional KD: 90% fat, 8% protein, 2% carbs (4:1 ratio)
- Low-carb KD (LCKD): 70-80% fat, 5-10% carbs, 10-20% protein (may offer greater benefits)

### Study Quality:
- PRISMA guidelines followed
- Six databases searched (PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, Medline, Cochrane)
- Independent dual review process
- Risk of bias assessed per Cochrane Handbook

### Limitations Noted:
- "Limited number of studies"
- Ongoing debates about overall effectiveness
- Need for more robust evidence on optimal KD composition

## NEXT STEPS:
- Search for glioblastoma-specific studies
- Search for pancreatic cancer evidence
- Search for Warburg effect mechanisms
- Search for contraindications and cachexia risks
- Search for oncology guidelines on KD recommendations

**Citation**: Amaral LJ, Gresham G, Kim S, et al. A phase 1 safety and feasibility trial of a ketogenic diet plus standard of care for patients with recently diagnosed glioblastoma. Sci Rep. 2025;15:21064.

**Study Type**: Single-arm phase 1 clinical trial (NCT03451799)

**Study Details**:
- **Setting**: Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
- **Enrollment**: April 2018 - February 2021
- **Sample**: 17 evaluable patients with recently diagnosed GBM
- **Intervention**: 16-week supervised 3:1 KD (Fat:Carb+Protein) + standard of care chemoradiation
- **Follow-up**: Remote monitoring with twice-daily blood glucose and ketone measurements

### Patient Characteristics:
- **Median age**: 55 years
- **Sex**: 53% female, 47% male
- **Median KPS**: 85
- **Ethnicity**: 94% non-Hispanic White
- **Tumor genetics**: 16 IDH1 wild-type, 1 IDH1 mutant
- **MGMT status**: 7 methylated, 9 unmethylated, 1 indeterminate

### Primary Outcome - SAFETY:
**Result**: ALL 17 patients met safety objective
- **Zero instances** of excessive weight loss
- **No serious adverse events** related to diet
- **Conclusion**: KD is SAFE for GBM patients receiving standard of care

### Secondary Outcome - FEASIBILITY:
**Result**: EXCEEDED feasibility target
- **100% adherence**: All 17 patients maintained nutritional ketosis (≥0.3 mM) >50% of study days
- Pre-specified target was >50% of patients achieving this
- **Conclusion**: KD is FEASIBLE with proper supervision

### Adverse Events (Grade 1-3):
- **Total**: 46 AEs possibly/probably attributable to KD in 10 patients
- **Most common**: Loss of appetite (9 patients, grade 1-2)
- **Weight loss**: Grade 1 in 3 patients
- **Flu-like symptoms**: 5 events in 3 patients (1 grade 2, rest grade 1)
- **Constipation**: 8 patients (1 grade 3 event)
- **Diarrhea**: 6 patients
- **Fatigue**: 4 patients
- **Critical**: NO patients discontinued due to diet intolerance

### Survival Outcomes (KEY FINDINGS):
- **Median PFS**: 12.9 months from KD initiation
- **Median OS**: 29.4 months from KD initiation
- **Context**: Standard GBM survival is 15-20 months
- **Interpretation**: Nearly 10-month survival improvement over historical controls

### Quality of Life & Cognitive Function:
- QOL remained **stable or improved** (not statistically significant)
- Symptom control **stable or improved**
- Cognitive function **stable or improved**
- Pilot study (2015) noted improvements in: energy, mood, neurocognitive function, seizure control

### Mechanisms Cited:
1. **Warburg Effect**: Cancer cells exhibit increased glycolysis even under aerobic conditions
2. **Metabolic dependence**: GBM depends on glycolysis for biosynthetic, bioenergetic, and signaling needs
3. **Differential stress**: KD restricts glucose availability, creating differential stress on cancer vs. normal cells

### Diet Supervision:
- Close dietary supervision with registered dietitian
- Regular monitoring of glucose and ketone levels
- Remote monitoring technology (Keto-Mojo meters provided)
- Weight/BMI, physical activity, and sleep tracking

### Evidence Level:
- **Moderate** for safety and feasibility in GBM
- **Preliminary** for efficacy (phase 1, no control group)
- Published July 2025 [RECENT]

### Future Research:
- **NCI-funded multicenter randomized trial** currently underway (DIET2TREAT)
- Phase 2 trial to assess efficacy with proper control group

### App Implications:
1. Emphasize need for medical supervision and dietitian support
2. Remote monitoring features for glucose/ketone tracking
3. Weight monitoring with alerts for excessive loss
4. Symptom tracking for common AEs (appetite, GI issues, fatigue)
5. Educational content on Warburg effect and metabolic mechanisms
6. Connection to clinical trial resources
7. Disclaimer: Not a replacement for standard cancer treatment

### Contraindications/Cautions:
- Requires medical clearance before starting
- Need for close monitoring during cancer treatment
- Potential for weight loss (though manageable)
- GI side effects common but manageable
- Must be combined with standard of care, not as replacement
